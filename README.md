The application allows users to look up businesses in the Corvallis area where they can donate objects to be reused or get their broken things repaired rather than sending them to the landfill. The application is supported by a MySQL database of the companies and the things they accept, a web interface for administrators to update the database, and a moderately RESTful web API for the application to retrieve the information.
