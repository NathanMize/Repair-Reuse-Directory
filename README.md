The application allows users to look up businesses in the Corvallis area where they can donate objects to be reused or get htere broken things repiared rather than sending them to the landfill. The application is supoorted by a MySQL database of the companies and the things they accept, a web nterface for administrators to update the database, and a moderately RESTful web API for the application to retreive the information.
